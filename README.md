# TODO-App

Project developed with the aim of practicing the use of webpack, native Javascript and OOP programming. The web application was obtained with the use of native Javascript, without the use of frameworks or external libraries except for the date-fns library to manipulate dates more easily. To make the application responsive I used the CLAMP function of css and for minor resolutions the media queries. Storage was achieved with the use of LocalStorage. In an early version of the code I had mixed too much application logic with DOM manipulation, so I reworked the code and tried to make them as independent as possible from each other. In retrospect, I can say that there was a lack of adequate initial planning of the features that the application should have, this meant that the code was not written in the best possible way.
